# cstoolbox

This is a sample, minimal C# class library I've created for my own learning purposes. The intent is that some ultimately useful code may make it into here, making this repository more valuable than simply a reference for a minimal library. 

Currently, there are the following classes:
- `Algebra`: methods for simple algebraic computations
- `StringManipulation`: methods for simple string manipulation 

... more to come!
